Instruction
Use the map method on lighthouses so that we instead see an array
of numbers.

The array of numbers should be the length of each name in the
lighthouses.

The goal of this exercise is to continue practicing your ability to work with arrays and objects, this time with minimal help or step-by-step instructions.

We'll be implementing a program that manages music playlists using objects and arrays.

The program will consist of:

An object, the library, that will store all the information about tracks and playlists
A collection of functions that will perform certain operations on the library, for example addPlaylist
